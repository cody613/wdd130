    <h2>Client Report</h2>
    <p>I decided to make my site plan a crocheting website because my wife loves the hobby and I wanted to surprise her. I found pictures online of patterns I thought she would like. I emailed my lead developer (Chloe Tranquil) over email and Canvas a bit into the project because she had never reached out to me. She would not respond to any of my follow-up emails over the course of the project until July 16th, when she said she was working on it but still provided no link for me to see anything. I can't recall her ever really being in class when I was there, once I put her name to her face. Logan Juttner was one of the jr developers and eventually worked with me late in the project and made his page and the nav, so he's pretty cool. As far as I can see from the link he provided, nothing else was done. Overall, I am disappointed, but I do appreciate Logan's work. I suppose what I would do differently is vet my developers better before hiring. </p>

    <h2>Lead Developer Report</h2>
    <p>I assigned each child page and provided collaborator links to both my jr developers, sent a site link to my client (Camilla), all during the first week over email. I got off to a slow start because I struggled learning how to use GitHub (pushing/pulling), but after that, things went well. Einar and I updated each other regularly, and I sent my client updates when I thought things looked well enough to show her. However, Cloe was also a junior developer for me; she never responded to emails until July 16th, and never posted anything on GitHub for the site as of writing this. </p>

    <h2>Junior Developer Report</h2>
    <p>I communicated with my teams over text and Canvas. One team I really enjoyed working on was led by Parker Jenson, who was the lead developer. But Kim Soohwan, my other lead, never returned my messages until very late in the project and said it was because he was sick and absent. I made all the HTML and CSS for my child page (rankings) by that point, so I then provided a .zip file of it for him to use cause he seemed lost. So I have no uploads on GitHub for the site, but I did most of the work. So that was probably a mistake on my part to learn from. I feel that the site plans were pretty clear for both sites overall. I had no issues on GitHub for these sites. </p>

    <h2>General Experience Report</h2>
    <p>Learning GitHub was difficult at first, but Brother Alvey helped me, and I got the hang of it from there. I enjoyed working in teams when everyone communicated and contributed. I would probably try sending out even more follow-up messages to people who simply never responded for weeks on end. I have more confidence working on real-world projects because when I was on a good team, it felt very rewarding for us all to be making progress together. </p>
